FileViewerPlugin
================

Cordova File Viewer Plugin for Android based on the WebIntent plugin by Boris Smus (@borismus) - https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-plugins/tree/master/Android/WebIntent

This has been modified to only contain the parts needed and some methods were renamed, etc.

It was created for the SpiderOak Mobile Client project - https://github.com/SpiderOak/SpiderOakMobileClient

Follows the [Cordova Plugin spec](https://github.com/alunny/cordova-plugin-spec), so that it works with the [Cordova CLI tools](https://github.com/apache/cordova-cli/).
